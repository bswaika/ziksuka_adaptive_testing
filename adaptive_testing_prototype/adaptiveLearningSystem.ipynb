    "**Item Response Theory** is briefly divided into two categories based on approaches taken:\n",
    "1. Classical Item Response Theory\n",
    "    -ML estimator with maximum-information selection\n",
    "2. Bayesian Item Response Theory\n",
    "    -MAP estimator with selection from posterior\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Item Response Theory** is also briefly divided into three categories based on the models used:\n",
    "- 3PL-model (3-parameter logistic model)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  >Parameters a,b,c indicating discrimination,difficulty and guessing respectively\n",
    "  \n",
    "  >Good model for MCQ tests where guessing creates a lot of unexpected errors in estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2PL-model (2-parameter logistic model)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  >Parameters a,b indicating discrimination and difficulty\n",
    "  \n",
    "  >Good model for tests where guessing is highly unlikely, like in Fill in the Blanks tests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1PL-model (1-parameter logistic model or Rasch model)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  >Parameter b indicating difficulty\n",
    "  \n",
    "  >Good model for tests that assume for a difficult question, all able students do equally well\n",
    "    \n",
    "**The IRT Equation:**\n",
    "p_i(theta) = c_i + ( (1 - c_i) / (1 + e ^ ( -a_i * (theta - b_i) ) )\n",
    "\n",
    "*For 2PL-models, c_i = 0*\n",
    "\n",
    "*For 1PL-models, a_i = 1, c_i = 0*\n",
    "    \n",
    "Briefly going into the terms used above:\n",
    "- Score Estimate(theta) : It represents the estimated score of a subject from the sample\n",
    "- Difficulty(b) : It represents the difficulty of an item and shifts the **Item Response Function** towards left or right\n",
    "- Discrimination(a) : It represents how well an item discriminates between subjects of the sample having extreme score estimates and also determines slope of the **Item Response Function**\n",
    "- Guessing Probability(c) : It represents how guessing affects the score estimate of a sample and shifts the whole **Item Response Function** up based on that intercept\n",
    "    \n",
    "Generally the design principles governing any **Computer Adaptive Test** using **IRT** are:\n",
    "1. Creating an item bank based on the model of IRT being used\n",
    "2. Calibrating the item bank to have close to reality difficulty,discrimination or guessing probability\n",
    "3. Starting the test and initial ability estimation\n",
    "4. Selecting questions based on current ability estimate\n",
    "5. Interim ability estimation based on item responses\n",
    "6. Stopping rule\n",
    "7. Final ability estimation for displaying scores\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, the specifications mentioned below have been followed:\n",
    "* 1-PL model having only item difficulty\n",
    "* Initial ability estimation is done from a uniform Beta distribution as a prior\n",
    "* A mixed approach for item selection and ability estimation\n",
    "  - MAP estimator for ability estimation (as mentioned in the pyMC reference prescribed)\n",
    "  - Maximum information item selection (this is a classical approach)\n",
    "  - The reason for deviating from Bayesian Modelling for item selection\n",
    "    + Resource did not explain item selction from posterior distribution\n",
    "    + pyMC docs are not that readable or understandable for people with no statistical background\n",
    "* Stopping rule is determined by the quizLength attribute of the Quiz class which basically is the number of questions to be administered before stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "Few points worth mentioning:\n",
    "+ The quiz starts at minimum ability and on answering the first question wrong, cannot display any other item that is less difficult, so carries on with questions of higher difficulty although increasing in steps based on its adaptive-ness\n",
    "+ On answering the first question correctly, there is a bump to the hardest question in the question bank because the theta value of the learner jumps to 1.0 thus fetching the toughest question and on answering the toughest question correctly, keeps the score as 1.0 and since it cannot find anything tougher in the item bank displays easier questions. This could be quite a good place for the introduction of a 2PL model and a variable quiz length\n",
    "+ For average students, the test would work almost fine, since it could be highly estimated that almost everyone (~99%) would be able to answer the easiest question correctly and many would not be able to answer the toughest question correctly.\n",
    "+ Final Score Estimation has not been done in this project as that would much likely be application specific and since the score estimate ranges between 0 and 1 it could easily be multiplied by 100 to get a percentage score\n",
    "+ Not everything is very efficient complexity-wise, although they can later be looked at if decreasing time complexity is possible\n",
    "+ Lastly, the questions.txt file basically contains four sets of the same 5 questions with varied levels of difficulty for demonstration purposes. The answers to those questions have been marked with an asterisk so as to let the user decide if to act frantically or not. Moreover the item bank is not calibrated and the difficulty values for items have just been assigned randomly."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, the adaptive test battery shown above demonstrates how the way of selcting items and score estimation provides adaptiveness in the system. This system works best for the average student(with theta 0.2 - 0.8). This is due to a few drawbacks in the implementation\n",
    "- a very small item bank which is not properly calibrated\n",
    "- items have not been modelled to have a discrimination parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these are very easily solvable by very few changes in the code because only the IRF(Item Response Function) and IIF(Item Information Function) mathematics changes which is easy to write and implement. Making the item bank large is very easy, just calibrating it could take some time if done with the help of some prior test which imitates the type of items in the item pool. There are other ways of calibrating the item bank with the help of statistical software but that is not a very good approach as sampling stuff from a software cold often be erroneous than manually doing it. Its better to launch a linear version of the adaptive test which would give us the data on how to parameterize our questions based on the difficulty and discrimination parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, worth mentioning 3PL models could be used but that would have very little effect on the adaptiveness of the system. It is recommended to have a lot of questions of the same difficulty but with different discrimination values.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the system models the functional part of the adaptive testing system.\n",
